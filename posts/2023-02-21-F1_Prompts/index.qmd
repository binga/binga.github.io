Unless you are living under a rock, you must be aware of ChatGPT. As a racing enthusiast, I was interested in generating racing statistics using ChatGPT. While I was succesful to an extent, there are still some issues with the model. Let's jump into the details.

# Going broad

To test the limits of ChatGPT, I decided to go broad and ask "What is the total number of pit stops taken by Lewis Hamilton in Formula 1 2020 season?"

ChatGPT gets this incorrect. There is no way that Lewis Hamilton took 5 pitstops in the entire season. So, instead of going this approach, I decided to go with a more specific question.

# Start narrow and build slowly.

### Start with a simple question
I asked "Show a table with names of each race in f1 2020 season?"

A quick look at wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Formula_One_World_Championship) shows that this is accurate. This is a good step. Now, let's add race-wise pitstop data to the table.

### Add details

On the first look, this looks good. But, there is a problem. While the model generated reasonable statistics, they are not accurate. A quick check at [Austrian Grand Prix](https://www.racefans.net/2020/07/09/2020-austrian-grand-prix-interactive-data-lap-charts-times-and-tyres/) and [Styrian Grand Prix](https://www.racefans.net/2020/07/13/2020-styrian-grand-prix-interactive-data-lap-charts-times-and-tyres/) confirms that Lewis did not take 2 & 3 pitstops during the race.

While this certainly looks like progress, we still have some way to go with factual accuracy. Let's try a simpler question, instead.

### Add more details
I asked ChatGPT to add a column where Lewis finished each race.

A cursorily glance at the table shows that the model is getting the finishing position correct. But, the positions data is incorrect for 2 races. I'll leave it to you to figure out which ones! :-)

# Takeaways
1. Without any coding and referencing multiple websites, I was able to pull this data. So, large language models like ChatGPT will be super useful in a wide variety of ways.
2. We still do not know the most appropriate ways to ask the model for the answer. We are figuring it out as we go.
3. The model is still not perfect. It is still making mistakes. But, it is getting better with time.
